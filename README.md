# ConfuciusRetrofitCoroutines

Further development of Confucius Android app: RecyclerView + Retrofit & coroutines.

Built with a lot of help from [Miriana Itani](https://www.womentech.net/speaker/Miriana/Itani#.XuIPKOgNmd5.linkedin), who explained Retrofit & coroutines to me and kindly shared her code as an example.

For more help with Retrofit, I found a very useful blog post: http://www.kotlincodes.com/kotlin/retrofit-with-kotlin/
